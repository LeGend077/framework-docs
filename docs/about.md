# About

This is CSS framework which changes the appearance of a site to Minecraft Bedrock UI(now with Java!) and supports all devices as it is responsive! You can't claim it yours but can use this on your website!

**About Me**: I'm [LeGend077](https://github.com/LeGend077). I love playing Minecraft Bedrock Edition and creating add-ons for it! I also love Web Development and Stuff.
